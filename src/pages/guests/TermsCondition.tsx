remote audio and video consultations with our healthcare practitioners;
the ability to ask our healthcare practitioners questions during consultations;
where appropriate, via the use of our Clinical Services, our doctors may prescribe medicines;
access to healthcare records we hold about you; and
access to other digital healthcare tools that provide health and lifestyle information.
Referrals to local and international accredited hospitals
Some medical conditions are not suitable for remote consultations via our Clinical Services, and you should always seek advice from a medical practitioner in person if you are unsure about whether you have been able to explain or communicate your medical needs through our Clinical Services, or if you have any concerns about the advice you receive from us or if it is different from other advice you have received.
You should not use our services in an emergency, or if you have a condition that you know will require a physical examination.
Our non-medical services such as our symptom checker and health content are for information purposes only. They should not be used for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. They provide information to you based on information entered. They do not diagnose your own health condition or make treatment recommendations for you. They are not a substitute for a doctor or other healthcare professional. We will not be held liable in relation to the output of our information services.
Our symptom checker will provide different types of information to you based on, amongst other things, the symptoms entered.
We provide our Clinical Services using reasonable skill and care from appropriately qualified, and experienced, staff and Practitioners. If you think that our services have not met this standard, please contact us as soon as possible. We will fix or re-perform, without charge, any services we agree do not meet this standard.

We recommend that the device from which you access the App is password protected, set to lock after a short period of inactivity.
From time to time, updates to the App may be made available to you. We recommend that you use the latest version of the App at all times, to take advantage of the latest enhancements. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded or streamed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms.

Our services are available to adults, and to children.
If you are accessing our services from outside the UK, you should check whether it is lawful to access our services in the territory where you are.

We may suspend our services or terminate user accounts if we reasonably suspect that they are being used in breach of the restrictions in this Section F.
<h3> OUR PRESCRIPTION SERVICE </h3>
How our prescription service works
In the Kenya, services are provided by qualified doctors registered with the Licensed according to Kenyan Law who are permitted to prescribe medicines without meeting the patient face to face.

Prescriptions are included in your plan. The cost of the prescription is set by the pharmacy. We will only cover the costs of prescriptions provided by our partner pharmacies. If the patient decides to use a pharmacy not on our list, the cost will not be covered by us.
The App may enable you to request that we send your prescription to a pharmacy near to you for you to collect during normal opening hours, or that it be delivered to you.
If you choose to have your prescription sent to a pharmacy that is near to your location, we will make reasonable attempts to contact that pharmacy and have the prescription sent to the chosen pharmacy within an hour.
If, within the app, you choose to pick up your order, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure your prescription is available for pick up from one of our partner pharmacies promptly but we have no control over or responsibility for any individual pharmacy, their policies in relation to acceptance or otherwise of prescriptions, opening hours, or availability of medicines prescribed. There are a number of factors which may impact on which pharmacy is chosen and there can be no guarantee that a pharmacy to which the prescription is delivered (if that option is chosen) will be the nearest pharmacy.
If, within the App, you choose to order your prescription medication for delivery to you, it will be despatched by our partner dispensing pharmacy. The terms of delivery are:
we will use reasonable endeavours to procure the processing and despatch of your prescription within 1 business day where the medication is in stock;
the delivery time following despatch should typically not exceed 2 business days to Lagos but please note that in relation to delivery to remote locations, that delivery time could be longer;
delivery costs are included in your plan
delivery will be within the timescale selected in the app where possible;
medications are personal to the person for whom they are intended and therefore may not be returned;
the medication needs to be signed for by yourself or someone authorised by you, at point of delivery;
if no one is available to take delivery of the order when delivery is first attempted, you will be responsible for the costs of re-delivery or can opt to pick up the order from the dispensing pharmacy. The recipient may have to follow the procedures of the relevant despatch company in order to collect the order, including picking it up from a depot.
Our partner dispensing pharmacies are not part of our organisation and, to the extent permitted by law, we disclaim responsibility for their acts and omissions.
<h3> OTHER LIMITS ON OUR SERVICE </h3>
Other limitations and restrictions on the use of services

Consultations generally are limited to 12.5 minute durations.
If you choose to submit details about your sympt211oms on the website, the information returned is on the basis of general healthcare information and not as personalised health advice for you. Where the information returned indicates that the symptoms entered suggest further medical advice is necessary, you acknowledge that you are responsible for seeking such advice from your doctor or other medical professional.
Healthcare practitioners may hold different clinical opinions on the same medical condition or symptoms and, provided these opinions are reasonably held, the fact that two or more healthcare practitioners give different opinions in the course of service provision does not necessarily indicate that our services are defective.
We do not tolerate abuse or offensive behaviour towards our staff.
Our services are designed to be accessed remotely by any of our customers, and are not designed for non-English speakers. If you are a non-English speaker, you must contact us prior to paying for our service or booking a consultation.

You should ensure that your devices used to access services are protected against viruses and malicious software. You must not use or expose the App or the Websites to virus or malicious software contamination.
You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the services, App or Websites.
